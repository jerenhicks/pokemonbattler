* do something about the secondary types. Either make it none or have it blank. Using null right now.

* In the first four generations, during the calculation, all operations are carried out on integers internallyâ€”this means that all division operations are truncated integer division (i.e. rounding down if the result is not an integer), and the results of multiplication operations are rounded down afterwards (truncating any fractional part). From Generation V onward, there are three different types of rounding; a flooring (the same as previous generations), rounding to the nearest integer while rounding down at 0.5, and rounding to the nearest integer while rounding up at 0.5.
